**Verbia CLI** is an open-source command-line tool for managing vocabulary lists to support your language learning
journey. Built with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), Verbia CLI makes it easy to create, manage, and review
vocabulary collections. This app leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) to generate word definitions, helping learners
efficiently expand their vocabulary.
